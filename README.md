## 📦 Prerequisites

Make sure your system has the following installed:

- ✅ Docker Compose  
- ✅ Git  
- ✅ Linux-based OS (tested on Ubuntu 22.04)  

Installation steps
```bash
sudo chmod +x ./.install.sh
sudo ./.install.sh
```
If you want to check the running docker compose
```bash
sudo chmod +x ./.cklabs.sh
sudo ./.cklabs.sh
```
If you want to start a lab
```bash
sudo chmod +x ./.start.sh
sudo ./.start.sh
```
## ⚠️ Resource Usage Warning

> **Note:** Running multiple labs simultaneously using `docker-compose` can be **resource intensive**.  
>
> - If your system has **sufficient resources** (e.g., CPU, RAM, and disk space), you may **add more labs** to expand your environment.
> - Otherwise, it's recommended to **keep the default labs** to ensure stable performance.

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

> - If you encounter a problem running docker compose caused by the port being used, edit the labs file by going in and running nano docker-compose.yml to edit the port within the file.
> - After editing the file, run sudo ./.start.sh again.
