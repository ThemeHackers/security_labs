## üì¶ Prerequisites

- ‚úÖ Linux-based OS (tested on Ubuntu 22.04)  

Installation steps

sudo ./.install.sh
```
If you want to check the running docker compose

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Resource Usage Warning

> **Note:** Running multiple labs simultaneously using `docker-compose` can be **resource intensive**.  
>
> - If your system has **sufficient resources** (e.g., CPU, RAM, and disk space), you may **add more labs** to expand your environment.
> - Otherwise, it's recommended to **keep the default labs** to ensure stable performance.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

> - If you encounter a problem running docker compose caused by the port being used, edit the labs file by going in and running nano docker-compose.yml to edit the port within the file.
